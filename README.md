# Pivotal Tracker GUI Testing Framework

This repository contains a GUI testing framework for automating tests on the Pivotal Tracker page.

## Introduction

The Pivotal Tracker GUI Testing Framework is designed to simplify and streamline the process of testing the Pivotal Tracker web application. It provides a set of reusable test cases and utilities that can be easily integrated into your test automation workflow.

## Features

- Easy setup and configuration
- Reusable test cases for common GUI interactions
- Support for multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- Extensible architecture for adding custom test cases
- Integration with popular testing frameworks (e.g., Selenium, Cypress)

## Getting Started

To get started with the Pivotal Tracker GUI Testing Framework, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/pivotal-tracker-gui-testing.git`
2. Install the necessary dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure the framework according to your testing environment (e.g., browser options, credentials, etc.)
4. Run the sample test cases: `npm test`
5. Customize and extend the framework to suit your specific testing needs.

## Logger

The framework includes a powerful logger that captures detailed information about the test execution. The logger records important events, error messages, and test case results, making it easier to troubleshoot issues and analyze test runs. The logs can be configured to be stored in a file or displayed in the console, providing flexibility for different use cases.

To enable the logger and customize its behavior, refer to the [logger documentation](docs/logger.md).
